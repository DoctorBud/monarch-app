## Directory to hold build-time generated artifacts

Currently, the only inhabitant of this directory will be `bbop.min.js`, as generated by the command:

```
./node_modules/.bin/webpack -p \
	--config=utils/bbop-webpack.config.js \
	./node_modules/bbop/bbop.js ./gen/bbop.min.js
```

which is embedded in `install.sh` and intended to execute only when new code has been obtained and/or the bbop version has changed.

The point of this is to speed up `npm run dev` by eliminating unnecessary per-change parsing. Ideally, the `bbop` module would be published to NPM with a minified module, but apparently not: https://github.com/berkeleybop/bbop-js/issues/37
