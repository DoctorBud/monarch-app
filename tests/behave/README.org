* Overview

  Essentially, the idea is this: there are human language-like files
  (features) that describe scenarios--pre-conditions, actions, and
  their results; separately, there is code that maps these statements
  to python selenium code and assertions (steps).

  What this gets you is a pretty nice separation between the tests and
  the code. The test language is simple and can be built up in such a
  way that a complete non-programmer can easily write unit tests,
  snapping them together like legos. The developer makes the legos and
  run the tests. With the whole BDD thing there is a lot of kool-aid
  being passed around (actually driving development with this seems a
  bit mad to me), but being able to have a separation of concerns
  between the human language-esque tests and the plumbing will allow
  us to actually build up a body of tests without taking too much away
  from development time.

* Tags

  These are the tags that we're currently using in the tests (in case
  you want to check or remove just a subset).

  - ui: tests written for the Monarch-app UI, likely Selenium
  - data: tests specific to testing the sanity of Monarch data
