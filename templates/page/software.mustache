          <h1>Monarch Software</h1>
          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>
            This site is driven by APIs built on top of the NIF
            infrastructure. In particular,
            <ul>
              <li><b>OntoQuest</b> for ontology queries </li>
              <li><b>Federation Queries</b> for data resources </li>
            </ul>
            The monarch API is layered on top of these services. It is
            written in javascript, and can be executed in a browser or
            server environment. See <a href="/docs/index.html">the API
            docs</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The web browser is written using the lightweight
            RingoJS/stick framework. See the github project page for
            details.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The Monarch API makes use of resources ingested into the
            NIF DISCO system as part of the Monarch project. These
            include Human Phenotype Ontology annotations (many done as
            part of the NIH PATO project) and computational analyses
            run using the OWLSim/PhenoDigm system.
          </p>
          <h3>Installing locally</h3>
          <p>
            It is very easy to install the web application
            locally. Assuming you have git installed, clone the
            project (see link in menubar above), run the install
            script, and then run the start-server script. That's it!
          </p>

          <p>
            If you wish to make changes, see the README.md and
            README-developers.md. You can either fork the project and
            push changes, or simply ask to have your github account
            added to the list of project members. See the guthub docs
            for more details.
