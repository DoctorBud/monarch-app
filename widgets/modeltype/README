This file describes how to include the modeltype.js file in a webpage.  The following .js code is required:

- jQuery (tested with 1.11.0)
- jQuery UI (tested with 1.10.3)
- d3 (tested with 3.2.4)

To add the ModelType to the page:

- create a list of phenotypes as an array of Javascript objects with the following attributes:
    [{ id:"HP:0000006", observed:"positive"},{ id:"HP:0000726", observed:"positive"},...];
- create a <div> tag to contain the widget
- add the widget to the div tag as follows.  The following example assumes you are adding the widget to a div
    with an id="phen_vis": 
            $("#phen_vis").modeltype({serverURL : "http://tartini.crbs.ucsd.edu", phenotypeData: phenotypes,
	   				      target_species: "10090" });
	   				      
Widget Parameters
To add the widget, you must set some parameters.  The following are the most common parameters 

- phenotypeData [required]- this is the only required parameter.  It is a Javascript array of objects listing the 
   phenotypes to be rendered in the widget.
- serverURL [optional*]- *this parameter is only optional if the widget is being deployed within the Monarch
   Initiative website.  Otherwise, you must set it to a URL accessible to your website that contains the Monarch web services.
   You will also need to handle the cross-site scripting (XSS) issues you will encounter when you specify this URL.
   Option 1: Use http://tartini.crbs.ucsd.edu to connect to the development/test web services.  This server is less stable 
      than the production server.
   Option 2: Use http://monarch.monarchinitiative.org to connect to the stable, production version of the web services (better uptime)
- targetSpecies [optional]- this parameter defaults to 10090 (mus musculus).  Change this parameter if you want to compare the
   phenotypes in the pheotypeData parameter against a different species.
