Steps for Adding the ModelType Viewer Widget to Your Webpage

   This page describes how to include the Viewer Widget on any webpage. Steps are provided for adding required javascript files*, adding parameters to the widget call, and adding the widget to the html file.

	*Required files are available at: https://github.com/monarch-initiative/monarch-app/tree/master/widgets/modeltype
	
1. Add the Required Javascript Libraries and Image

    The following .js code libraries are required:
        jQuery (tested with 1.11.0)
        jQuery UI (tested with 1.10.3)
        d3 (tested with 3.2.4)
    The custom javascript file for the ModelViewer widget is required.
        modeltype.js
    Create a new html file and add all required javascript files within the html <head> tags
        Example:

        <head>
             <script src="js/jquery-1.11.0.min.js"></script>
             <script src="js/jquery-ui-1.10.3.custom.min.js"></script>
             <script src="js/d3.min.js"></script>
             <script src="js/modeltype.js"></script>
        </head>

    The logo.png file is required:
        Make sure that there is an "image" directory directly below the html file directory.
        Place "logo.png" in the image directory


2. Add a List of Phenotyopes and a jQuery Function Call

    Create a list of phenotypes as an array of Javascript objects with the following attributes:

        [{ id:"HP:0000006", observed:"positive"}, id:"HP:0000726", observed:"positive"},...];

        Note that the phenotypes may also be passed in as a JSON list and that the "observed" tag may be omitted.

        Example: { "HP:0000006" , "HP0000726",...}

    Add a jQuery .ready function that will add the widget to an empty div tag (see Step 3) as follows (The following example assumes you are adding the widget to a div with an id="phen_vis"):

        jQuery(document).ready(function(){$("#phen_vis").modeltype(
        	{serverURL: "http://tartini.crbs.ucsd.edu", phenotypeData: phenotypes, target_species: "10090" });
        });

        Widget Parameters
        To add the widget, you must set some parameters. The following are the most common parameters:
            a.phenotypeData [required] - It is a Javascript array of objects listing the phenotypes to be rendered in the widget.
            b.serverURL [required] - This URL should be pointed to the OWLSim URL server associated with your installation containing the Monarch web services.
                Option 1: Use http://tartini.crbs.ucsd.edu to connect to the development/test web services. This server is less stable than the production server.
                Option 2: Use http://monarch.monarchinitiative.org to connect to the stable, production version of the web services (better uptime)
            c.targetSpecies [optional]- this parameter defaults to 10090 (mus musculus). Change this parameter if you want to compare the phenotypes in the phenotypeData parameter against a different species. Available Species:
                Name: Homo sapiens Taxon: 9606
                Name: Dani rerio Taxon: 7955
                Name: Drosophila melanogaster Taxon: 7227
    Add the phenotype array and the jQuery function between <script> tags in the html <head>
        Example:

        <script>
        	var phenotypes = [
        		{ id:"HP:0000006", observed:"positive"},
        		{ id:"HP:0000726", observed:"positive"},
        		{ id:"HP:0000746", observed:"positive"}];
        		
        	jQuery(document).ready(function(){
        		$("#phen_vis").modeltype({serverURL : "http://tartini.crbs.ucsd.edu", 
        			phenotypeData: phenotypes, targetSpecies: "10090" });	
        	});
        </script>


3. Add the Widget <div>:

    Add an empty <div> tag in the body of the html file.
    Example:

    <body>	
    	<div id="phen_vis"></div>
    <body>


4. Add tbe HTML File on the Server
Just add your html file and the required .js libraries where they are visible on your server. You're done!
