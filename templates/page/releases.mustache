                            We provide an ability to navigate multi-scale spatial and
                            temporal phenotypes across in vivo and in vitro model systems
                            in the context of genetic and genomic data, using semantics and
                            statistics. Our system provides basic and clinical science
                            researchers, informaticists, and medical professionals with
                            an integrated interface and set of discovery tools to reveal
                            the genetic basis of disease, facilitate hypothesis generation,
                            and identify novel candidate drug targets. We aim for this system
                            to promote true translational research, in that clinicians can
                            connect with model systems researchers with expertise in
                            related phenotypes, assays, or models.
