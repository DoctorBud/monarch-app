NAVLIST

Currently, there are three navlist HTML templates:
    (1) navlist.mustache
        This is used for all pages except the two specified below.
    (2) navlist_disease.mustache
        This is used just for disease pages. It adds the Navigation section
        to the traditional navlist.
    (3) navlist_phenotype.mustache
        This is used just for phenotype pages. It adds a different
        Navigation section to the traditional navlist.
