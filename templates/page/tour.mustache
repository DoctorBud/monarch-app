                    Model systems are the cornerstone of biomedical research for
                    understanding of biological processes, testing gene-based disease
                    hypotheses, and developing and testing disease treatments.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    A wide-variety of model databases contain unparalleled content about
                    genetics, genomics, anatomy, environmental interactions, and
                    developmental processes. However, clinical and translational
                    researchers face a daunting challenge in using these vast stores of
                    biomedical data to inform their understanding of human disease mechanisms
                    that drives new therapies. This is particularly difficult in the
                    context of rare or undiagnosed diseases, where data is limited to
                    descriptive phenotypic data and numerous candidate genomic variations.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    Currently, tools that exploit similarities between phenotypes,
                    organisms, and human diseases to leverage these rich data are in
                    their infancy or are non-existent. To address this challenge, the
                    Monarch Initiative Discovery System contains a wealth of information
                    about model organisms, in vitro models, genes, pathways, gene
                    expression, protein and genetic interactions, orthology, disease,
                    phenotypes, publications, and authors with semantic similarity
                    calculations that suggest novel relationships based on the information
                    content of data descriptions.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    We will provide tools that will use semantics and statistical models
                    to support navigating through multi-scale spatial and temporal phenotypes
                    across in vivo and in vitro model systems in the context of genetic and
                    genomic data. These tools will provide basic and clinical science
                    researchers, informaticists, and medical professionals with an integrated
                    interface and set of discovery tools to reveal the genetic basis of
                    disease, facilitate hypothesis generation, and identify novel candidate
                    drug targets. We aim for this system to promote true translational
                    research, connecting clinicians with model systems researchers who might
                    shed light onrelated phenotypes, assays, or models.

                    The Monarch system is built based upon the foundation of the
                    <a href="http://neuinfo.org/">Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF)</a>. NIF's large scale
                    data ingest system, DISCO, enables the aggregation, provenance, and
                    currency of hundreds of external resources. The Monarch Initiative is
                    performing sophisticated curation and mapping of many of these resources
                    to an integrated suite of ontologies for
                    <a href="https://code.google.com/p/phenotype-ontologies/">phenotypes and diseases</a>,
                    genotypes, and <a href="http://www.obofoundry.org/wiki/index.php/UBERON:Main_Page">anatomy</a>.
                    The ontology services are provided by NIF Ontoquest. The OWLsim algorithmic
                    tools enable the comparison of sets of entities across the corpus.
                    Visualization tools to explore this semantic landscape are being developed
                    by the University of Pittsburgh Human computer interactions team.
                    See documentation for more information.
